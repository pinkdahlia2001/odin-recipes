 <p>With just a <strong>few</strong> ingredients and a <strong>quick preparation time</strong>, these shortbread cookies are easy to make and offer a unique twist on the classic recipe. The lavender adds a soothing aroma and flavor, making them a delightful addition to any dessert table.</p>
 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul>
   <li>200g unsalted butter (softened)</li> 
   <li>100g caster sugar</li>
   <li>1 tsp dried lavender buds (finely chopped)</li>
   <li>300g plain flour</li>
   <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
   <li>1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Instructions</h2>
 <ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the butter</strong>: Preheat your oven to 170°C (340°F) and line a baking tray with parchment paper. In a large bowl, cream the softened butter and caster sugar together until light and fluffy.</li>
    <li><strong>Add lavender</strong>: Stir in the finely chopped lavender buds and vanilla extract (if using). Mix well to evenly distribute the lavender. </li>
    <li><strong>Combine the dry ingredients</strong>: In a separate bowl, whisk together the plain flour and salt. Gradually add this to the butter mixture, mixing until just combined. The dough should be soft but not sticky. </li>
    <li><strong>Shape the dough</strong>: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently roll it into a ball. Flatten the dough to about 1/4-inch thickness and use a cookie cutter or knife to shape the shortbread into rounds or squares.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake the shortbread</strong>: Place the shortbread on the prepared baking tray and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Keep an eye on them to avoid over-baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool and serve</strong>: Allow the shortbread to cool on the tray for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy with tea or as a sweet treat! </li>
