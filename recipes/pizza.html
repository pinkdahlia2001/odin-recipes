    <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients</strong>: In a large bowl, combine the strong bread flour, 00 pizza flour, and salt.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the levain</strong>: Mix in the active levain (sourdough starter) and water gradually. Stir the mixture until a rough dough starts to form.</li>
    <li><strong>Knead the dough</strong>: On a floured surface, knead the dough for about 8-10 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. Add more flour if needed. </li>
    <li><strong>Rest the dough</strong>:Place the dough in a bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise for 2 hours at room temperature, or until it has doubled in size. For a more authentic taste, you can allow the dough to ferment in the fridge for up to 24 hours for deeper flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Shape the dough</strong>: Once the dough has risen, divide it into two equal portions (for two pizzas). Roll each piece into a ball, then cover them and let them rest for another hour.</li>
    <li><strong>Tomato sauce</strong>:In a small bowl, spread the tomato passata evenly. Season with a pinch of salt if desired.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the mozzarella</strong>: Slice the fresh mozzarella into small pieces and drain any excess moisture. This will prevent the pizza from getting soggy.</li>
    <li>Wash and set aside fresh basil leaves to garnish the pizza.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the dough</strong>: Mix flour, salt, levain, and water. Knead until smooth, then let it rise for 2 hours (or ferment in the fridge for up to 24 hours).</li>
